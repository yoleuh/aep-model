# Safety Classification Project

This project uses machine learning to classify safety comments into high priority and standard priority categories. It fine-tunes a deep learning transformer-based neural network [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased), adapting it to the specific task of safety observation classification.

## Project Structure

- `safety_classification.py`: Script for training the model, evaluating its performance, and generating results for the entire dataset.
- `classify_new_inputs.py`: Interactive script for classifying new safety comments using the trained model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project.

## Usage: Training on Your Own Data

### Training the Model and Generating Results

1. Prepare your data:

   - Create a CSV file with at least two columns: one for the safety comments and one for the priority labels.
   - Name your columns exactly as they are in the original dataset or update the column names in the `safety_classification.py` script.
   - Move your CSV file to the `data/` directory.
   - Rename it to `data.csv` or update the file path in `safety_classification.py`.

2. Run the training and classification script:

   ```
   python3 safety_classification.py
   ```

3. This script will:

   - Train the model on the included dataset
   - Evaluate its performance
   - Save the model and tokenizer in the `saved_model` and `saved_tokenizer` directories respectively
   - Classify all comments in the original dataset
   - Save the results (including classifications) to `results/output_data.csv`

### Interactively Classifying New Inputs

1. After training the model, you can use it to classify new safety comments interactively:

   ```
   python3 classify_new_inputs.py
   ```

2. This script will:

   - Load the trained model and tokenizer
   - Prompt you to enter safety comments
   - Display the classification (High Priority or Standard Priority) and confidence score for each entered comment

3. Enter your safety comments one at a time and press `Enter` to see the classification result.

4. Type 'quit' to exit the program.

## Our Training Data Results

```
Evaluation Results:
Accuracy: 0.9910
F1 Score: 0.9833
Precision: 0.9925
Recall: 0.9742
```

## Notes

- The scripts are set to use CPU for computations. If you have a GPU and want to use it, set USE_CPU to False in both scripts.

  ```python
  # Configurable variables
  USE_CPU = False
  ```

- This project utilizes the DistilBERT base model (uncased) for sequence classification. DistilBERT is a smaller, faster version of BERT, developed by Hugging Face. DistilBERT is a transformers model, pretrained on the same corpus as BERT in a self-supervised fashion, using the BERT base model as a teacher. It's designed for tasks that use the whole sentence to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification, or question answering.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Make sure you've run `safety_classification.py` before trying to use `classify_new_inputs.py`.
- Training the model will take a while, and will be physically demanding on your machines RAM. If this is an issue, the MAX_STEPS variable can be decreased, or another model can be used.
